# Rankings

This package holds PopRank's NFT rankings logic. Curious as to how we calculate our rarity and aesthetics scores? Well, we believe it should be transparent, so it's all laid out publicly here!

For a more hands-on example which involves pulling NFTs from OpenSea via their API and then calculating their rarity, check out the example in our [@poprank/opensea package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@poprank/opensea)
